# Simple Banking System

This project implements a simple Banking System using JavaScript. It consists of two separate files:

- **Bank.js**: A simple banking system without user interaction. This file demonstrates all operations (deposit, withdraw, transfer, check balance, and view transaction history) automatically using classes and methods.
- **Bank_User.js**: An interactive version of the banking system. It uses the Node.js `readline` module to allow user input for performing banking operations.

## How to Run

### Non-interactive Version

To run the simple banking system without user input, execute:

```bash
node Bank.js
```
